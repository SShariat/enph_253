// The artifact collection code. This detects an artifact impact, picks it up, swings the arm over the bucket, drops it off, then returns to its default state.

// Now, the expected setup will be that the robotic arm has some way of detecting the increase in weight an artifact will add to the arm. This then will prompt it to lift the object, rotate the base, rotate the servo on the end of the arm, then return all servos to their default position. Pretty simple code, actually.

// The current method of detecting an artifact is a QRD attached to the side of the artifact dropper. This has the advantage of being both lighter and more reliable than a physical switch. We use the QRD's crappy range for our own advantage! :D

// Anyhoo, the sensor usually reports values ranging from ~120 to 200-something, then drops to about 40ish when an artifact is collected. As such, I've made the threshold 100. We may want to reduce this at some point in the future, and feel free to make it a variable if you'd like, but it's not crucial for time trials.
